# emplayer
A basic and experimental mp3 player using HTA interface that supports playlists, but not recomended to use.  
This is a project from **2007**, and contains the source code for the files that are presently available, and the project files or build files are missing.  

See [Triton Player](https://github.com/midhunhk/triton-player), for a more modern iteration of this concept, built on Adobe AIR technology.  

**Added to version control for archival purposes**
